//  Synchronous (sync)
// Execution: Tasks are executed sequentially, one after another. The program waits for each task to complete before moving to the next one.
// Blocking: A synchronous task blocks the execution of subsequent code until it is finished.
// Use Case: Suitable for tasks that are short and donâ€™t involve waiting (e.g., performing a quick calculation or accessing a local variable).


// Example:

// void main() {
//   print("Task 1");
//   print("Task 2");
//   print("Task 3");
// }

// Output:

// Task 1
// Task 2
// Task 3


// Asynchronous (async)
// Execution: Tasks are executed in a non-blocking way. The program does not wait for an asynchronous task to complete and continues with the next task.

// Blocking: An asynchronous task does not block the execution of other code. Instead, it uses mechanisms like Future or Stream to return results when the task is completed.

// Use Case: Ideal for tasks that involve waiting, such as API calls, file reading, or database queries.

// Syntax: async is used to define an asynchronous function. await pauses the execution of the code until the awaited task is complete.

// Example:

// Future<void> main() async {
//   print("Task 1");
//   await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
//   print("Task 2");
//   print("Task 3");
// }
// Output:

// Task 1
// Task 2 (after 2 seconds)
// Task 3

class Test{
   add()
   {
     print("\nLine 1");
     print("\nLine 2");
     print("\nLine 3");
     

   }
}

void main()
{
  Test obj = Test();
  obj.add();
}
